Problem Statement
Many elderly individuals and people with disabilities struggle to find reliable, vetted caregivers and household support. Existing platforms often focus on pet care or general gig work, leaving a gap for specialized, trustworthy services tailored to health and home needs. Families need peace of mind knowing caregivers are qualified, background-checked, and capable of providing compassionate assistance.

What GoCare Strives to Do
GoCare aims to bridge this gap by creating a secure, user-friendly platform that connects nurses, CNAs, caregivers, and housekeepers with those who need them most. The app empowers caregivers to showcase their skills, certifications, and personality through customizable profiles, while ensuring safety through mandatory background checks. Clients can easily search, filter, and book trusted professionals based on experience, ratings, and price—bringing convenience and confidence to care.

Current Status
I am currently seeking funding to bring GoCare to market and scale its impact. You can view the live prototype here:
